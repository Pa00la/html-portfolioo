<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p> Hello there! My name is Paula, and I was born in El-Kalyobia. 
  I embarked on my professional journey at a young age, 
  working as an assistant doctor in a pharmacy when I was just 15-16 years old.
   Shortly after, I transitioned to being a teacher assistant, 
   which allowed me to explore my passion for education.</p>

<p>After completing high school,
   I took some time to focus on my studies and dedicated myself to my final year.
    Following that, I found myself drawn to the field of counseling and joined Wellspring,
     where I had an incredible experience. 
     The role not only allowed me to connect with and help others, 
     but I also made lifelong friends and gained invaluable knowledge.</p>

<p>One of my greatest passions is traveling.
   I have an insatiable curiosity for exploring unfamiliar places and immersing myself in different cultures. My dream is to travel across Egypt,
    unraveling its hidden gems, 
    before venturing abroad to discover even more captivating destinations.</p>

<p>Driven by my ambitions, 
  I pursued my dream of studying engineering, 
  which led me to the faculty of engineering. 
  Now, after five years of dedication and hard work,
   I find myself in the final year of my academic journey.
    Being a senior brings a sense of fulfillment and excitement for what lies ahead.</p>

<p>These days, 
  I am devoted to continuous learning and self-improvement. 
  I am constantly seeking new knowledge and striving to discover my true potential. 
  I am motivated by the desire to make a positive impact and bring about meaningful change in the world.</p>

<p>I'm delighted to have the opportunity to connect with you and share a glimpse into my life.
   I look forward to getting to know you as well,
    and discovering the unique experiences and aspirations that shape your journey.</p>
